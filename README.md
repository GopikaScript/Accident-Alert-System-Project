# Accident Alert System 🚨

This is a core-based Arduino project that detects accidents and sends an SMS alert to a predefined number using a GSM module.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- GSM Module (SIM800L/SIM900)
- Ultrasonic Sensors / Push Button
- 9V Battery or Lithium Cell
- Jumper Wires

## 📟 How it Works
- The sensor detects a sudden vibration (accident).
- The Arduino reads the signal and sends an SMS using the GSM module.
- The message contains a default alert and can be expanded to include GPS coordinates.

## 📁 Files Included
- `accident-alert-system.ino` — Arduino code to upload.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Integrate GPS for location tracking.
- Add real-time monitoring dashboard.
- Emergency call feature using GSM.

## 🤝 Teamwork
This project was completed as part of a collaborative effort.
